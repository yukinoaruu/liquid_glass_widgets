# 0.7.8

### Tweak

- **TWEAK**: `GlassThemeVariant.light` now intrinsically defaults to an optimal cool-tinted `glassColor` (`Color(0x32D2DCF0)`), stronger `refractiveIndex`, and boosted `ambientStrength` to ensure premium specular rendering and visible refraction (chromatic aberration) on flat white backgrounds, avoiding the luminosity-clamping dead zone.

### Examples

- **Apple News demo** (`example/lib/apple_news/apple_news_demo.dart`) — Fixed Impeller GPU command buffer overflow (`kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorSubmissionsIgnored`) on iOS 26 physical devices. Root cause: simultaneous high-resolution network image decoding saturated the Impeller submission queue. All `Image.network` calls replaced with pre-sized bundled assets (`example/assets/news_images/`, 660 KB, 20 images at 600px/360px, q=70). Topic grid card colors now match Apple News: solid category color fills the card at full opacity, photo overlaid at `Opacity(0.45)` to add texture without suppressing the color.

# 0.7.7

### Refactor

- **Internal**: Removed `GlassIndicatorTapMixin` and migrated `GlassTabBar` and `GlassSegmentedControl` fully to raw `Listener` pointer events, bringing them to parity with `GlassBottomBar`'s robust drag-cancel and press-and-hold handling.
---

# 0.7.6

### Bug Fixes

- **FIX**: `LiquidGlassBlendGroup` — `blendAmount` asymmetry between buttons in a group. The left button was attracting its right neighbour more strongly than vice versa on any group with 3+ shapes. Root cause: the smooth-union SDF was accumulated left-to-right, so the leftmost shape participated in N−1 blend passes while the rightmost participated in only 1. Fix: compute both a forward (L→R) and backward (R→L) pass and mix 50/50 — the two biases cancel exactly, producing symmetric attraction in both directions. For 2-shape groups the result is mathematically identical to before (`smoothUnion` is pairwise commutative). No API changes.

- **FIX**: `GlassButtonGroup` — Fixed an issue where the glass effect could bleed as a dark rectangular backdrop on Impeller when using `GlassQuality.premium` with `useOwnLayer: true`. A `ClipRRect(antiAlias)` is now applied around the group widget to accurately hard-clip the bleed at the superellipse boundary. This resolves the bleed issue without forcing a quality downgrade, allowing premium buttons inside the group to retain their full Impeller specular shading and lighting effects.

---

# 0.7.5

### Bug Fixes

- **FIX**: `GlassBottomBar` and `GlassSearchableBottomBar` — gesture reliability on simulator and desktop. Added `HitTestBehavior.opaque` to root `GestureDetector` so the full bar height consumes pointer events, preventing passthrough to widgets behind the bar.

- **FIX**: `GlassSearchableBottomBar` — keyboard flickering on physical devices. Focus is now requested after the expansion animation completes, preventing the IME from dismissing itself mid-animation.

- **FIX**: `GlassSearchableBottomBar` — dead zone / input passthrough at expanded search pill edges. The entire glass surface (including horizontal padding zones) now correctly claims taps and routes them to the search field.

### New — `GlassSearchBarConfig` SearchBar parity

Seven new parameters, all backwards-compatible:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `autoFocusOnExpand` | `bool` | `false` | `true` = keyboard opens automatically on expand (useful for modal search screens). |
| `trailingBuilder` | `WidgetBuilder?` | `null` | Replaces the mic icon with any custom widget. |
| `textInputAction` | `TextInputAction?` | `null` | Keyboard action key (`search`, `done`, `go`, …). |
| `keyboardType` | `TextInputType?` | `null` | Keyboard layout (`url`, `emailAddress`, …). |
| `autocorrect` | `bool` | `true` | Disable for codes, usernames, etc. |
| `enableSuggestions` | `bool` | `true` | Controls QuickType bar on iOS. |
| `onTapOutside` | `TapRegionCallback?` | `null` | Called when user taps outside the field — use to dismiss the keyboard. |

---

# 0.7.4


### New Components

- **`GlassSearchableBottomBar`** — `GlassBottomBar` with a morphing search pill that shares the same `AdaptiveLiquidGlassLayer` as the tab pill, producing iOS 26 liquid-merge blending between them. When `isSearchActive` is `true` the tab pill collapses and the search pill expands via spring animation. Configured via `GlassSearchBarConfig` (hint text, mic icon, logo builder, text controller).

### Examples

- **Apple News demo** (`example/lib/apple_news/apple_news_demo.dart`) — iOS 26 Apple News replica showcasing `GlassSearchableBottomBar`. Run with `flutter run -t example/lib/apple_news/apple_news_demo.dart`.

### Visual Fixes

- **FIX**: Default glow color on press changed from iOS system blue to a brightness-adaptive neutral white (`~35%` light / `~22%` dark), matching the bright grey-white highlight iOS 26 glass produces on interaction. Explicit `glowColor` values are unaffected.

---

# 0.7.3

### Performance — Dead Code Removal & Runtime Optimizations

**GPU: Shader binary size & instruction count**
- **PERF**: Deleted `rotate2d()` from `render.glsl` — it was compiled into every shader binary that includes this shared library but was never called anywhere in the codebase. Removes a `cos()`/`sin()` pair and one `mat2` construction from each compiled shader.
- **PERF**: Eliminated redundant `normalize()` call in `interactive_indicator.frag`. `length(toEdge)` was already computed as `edgeLen`; `normalize(toEdge)` was then recomputing the same length internally. Replaced with the algebraically identical `toEdge / edgeLen` to reuse the already-computed scalar.

**CPU: Dart-side paint loop (`glass_glow.dart`)**
- **PERF**: Removed unnecessary `canvas.save()`/`canvas.restore()` pair in `_RenderGlassGlowLayer.paint()` — no canvas state was being modified between them, making the push/pop overhead pure waste.

### Bug Fixes

- **FIX**: Corrected `_RenderGlassGlowLayer` glow tracking. A previous paint optimisation incorrectly assumed that `RadialGradient.createShader()` could be cached across position changes. In practice, `createShader(Rect.fromCircle(center: pos, ...))` bakes the gradient center into the shader at call time — reusing the cached `Paint` when `glowOffset` changed left the gradient frozen at its original position, causing the glow to snap to a fixed colour instead of following the pointer. The shader is now correctly recreated each frame (cheap for a simple radial gradient) and the `canvas.save()`/`restore()` removal is retained.
- **FIX**: Position-tracking glow now works on the Skia/Web (lightweight) path. `GlassGlow` captures pointer events and routes them to `GlassGlowLayer` via `maybeOf(context)` — but `LightweightLiquidGlass` never wrapped its child in `GlassGlowLayer`, so `maybeOf()` returned null and all pointer events were silently dropped. Added `GlassGlowLayer` wrapping to `LightweightLiquidGlass`, matching the Impeller path in `LiquidGlass`. The position-tracking spotlight (`RadialGradient` + `BlendMode.plus`) is renderer-agnostic and now gives the Skia/Web path the same iOS 26 light-follows-touch behavior as Impeller.
- **FIX**: Glow spotlight on first touch now appears immediately at the tap position. `_offsetController` previously initialised at `Offset.zero` and spring-animated to the touch point while alpha was simultaneously fading in — causing the glow to briefly appear at the widget's top-left corner and slide over. Fixed by snapping `_offsetController.value` to the touch position before starting the alpha animation, so the spotlight materialises at the exact tap location with no drift.
- **FIX**: Glow spotlight now tracks correctly inside button groups and toolbars. `GlassGlow` was passing `event.localPosition` (relative to the individual button widget) directly to `GlassGlowLayer`, which may live at the group/container level rather than the button level. Every button in a toolbar therefore sent a small offset like `(28, 28)` that always resolved to the same left-side position on the toolbar glass. Fixed by converting `event.localPosition` through global screen space to the `GlassGlowLayer`'s own local coordinate system (`myBox.localToGlobal → layerBox.globalToLocal`), which is correct regardless of how many levels separate `GlassGlow` from its owning `GlassGlowLayer`. Transform chains (scroll views, rotations, scales) are handled automatically.
- **FIX**: Glow radius now scales correctly on wide buttons. The previous formula (`glowRadius × shortestSide`) produced a 56 px spotlight on a 300×56 px pill button — a tiny isolated circle. Replaced with the geometric mean (`glowRadius × √(width × height)`) which scales proportionally to the button area. For square/round buttons the result is identical; for wide pill buttons the spotlight now covers the glass surface proportionally, matching iOS 26 behaviour.

---


# 0.7.2

### Performance & Polish

**Lightweight shader (`lightweight_glass.frag` — Skia / Web primary path)**
- **PERF**: Reduced pixel shader ALU instruction count by ~10-15 ops per fragment by analytically collapsing SDF geometry into surface normals, eliminating intermediate `length()`, `normalize()`, and `clamp()` calls in the normal derivation stage. Restored the `normalZ` Fresnel ramp to the correct `sqrt(1 - dot(n,n))` form (preserves smooth rim brightening on rounded corners).
- **FIX**: Adjusted `GlassBottomBar`, `GlassTabBar`, and `GlassSegmentedControl` jump animation from the default 500ms `bouncySpring` to a tight 350ms `snappySpring`, precisely matching iOS 26 segment-indicator physics.

**GPU: Impeller path (`liquid_glass_final_render.frag`, `render.glsl`, `sdf.glsl`)**
- **PERF**: Eliminated `length()`, division, and `normalize()` from the anisotropic specular calculation in `liquid_glass_final_render.frag`. `normalXY` decoded from the geometry texture is unit-length by construction; replaced with the pre-baked constant `0.9805806` (= 1/√1.04).
- **PERF**: Made `getHeight()` in `render.glsl` fully branchless using `clamp`/`step`/`mix`. The two original `if` branches caused warp divergence at the glass edge transition zone, serialising GPU execution for adjacent fragments.
- **PERF**: Collapsed four chained `step()` multiplications in `calculateLighting` into a single `step()` on their product. All inputs are non-negative by construction — mathematically identical, 3 fewer multiplies per lit fragment.
- **PERF**: Deleted `sdfSquircle` from `sdf.glsl` — byte-for-byte identical to `sdfRRect` (a placeholder for a reverted superellipse SDF). Both shape types now route to `sdfRRect`, reducing shader binary compile-time size.

**CPU: Dart-side pipeline (`liquid_glass_render_object.dart`, `liquid_glass_blend_group.dart`)**
- **PERF**: Cached the light direction vector (`cos`/`sin` of `lightAngle`) in `LiquidGlassRenderObject`. Trig is now only recomputed when `lightAngle` actually changes, not on every `_updateShaderSettings()` call triggered by visibility, blur, or color animations.
- **PERF**: Changed `GlassGroupLink.shapeEntries` from `List` to `Iterable`, eliminating a `.entries.toList()` heap allocation called 2–3 times per frame even for completely static glass.

---

# 0.7.1

### Bug Fixes

- **FIX**: `GlassBottomBar`, `GlassTabBar`, and `GlassSegmentedControl` pointer event handling.
  - Resolved an interaction glitch on desktop platforms (macOS/Web) where quickly tapping a segment or tab would prematurely snap the alignment, killing the spring physics and causing the indicator to teleport rather than smoothly jump.
  - Removed raw pixel-snapping from the `onHorizontalDragDown` handler. Pure taps now correctly leverage the full spatial distance between segments to generate an authentic iOS jump animation.

---

# 0.7.0

### New Components

- **`GlassDivider`** — iOS 26-style hairline separator, horizontal and vertical variants. Theme-adaptive opacity (dark: 20% white / light: 10% black). Decorative — hidden from screen readers.
- **`GlassListTile`** — iOS 26 Settings-style row with leading icon, title, subtitle, trailing widget, and automatic grouped dividers. Use inside a zero-padding `GlassCard` for grouped lists.
- Convenience constants: `GlassListTile.chevron` and `GlassListTile.infoButton`.
- **`GlassStepper`** — True iOS 26 `UIStepper` equivalent. Compact `−`/`+` glass pill with auto-repeat on hold, `min`/`max` clamping, `wraps` cycling, fractional `step`, and `HapticFeedback`.
- **`GlassWizard` + `GlassWizardStep`** — Glass multi-step flow with numbered indicators, checkmarks, and expandable step content. Replaces the incorrectly named `GlassStepper` wizard from the preview build.

### Accessibility

`GlassAccessibilityScope` — new widget that reads platform accessibility preferences and propagates them to all glass widgets in its subtree:

- **Reduce Motion** — spring animations (`GlassSegmentedControl`, `GlassTabBar`, `GlassBottomBar`, `GlassSwitch`, `GlassSlider`) snap instantly instead of animating when the system preference is active. Implemented centrally in `SpringBuilder`/`VelocitySpringBuilder`.
- **Reduce Transparency** — replaces the full glass shader pipeline with a plain `BackdropFilter(blur)` + frosted container when high-contrast mode is active. Zero GPU cost, shape clipping preserved.
- Opt-in — existing apps are unaffected until they add `GlassAccessibilityScope`.

Semantics updated across all remaining widgets to match iOS `UIAccessibility`:
- `GlassStepper` — VoiceOver value + swipe-up/down increment/decrement.
- `GlassBadge` — announces count ("N notifications") or status ("Active"). Badge visual is decorative.
- `GlassDivider` — `ExcludeSemantics` (decorative, invisible to VoiceOver/TalkBack).
- `GlassListTile` — `Semantics(button: true)` on tappable rows.
- `GlassProgressIndicator` — determinate announces percentage; indeterminate uses `liveRegion: true`.
- `GlassBottomBar` — tab items expose `selected: true/false` for active-tab announcement.
- `GlassSheet` drag handle — labeled "Drag handle" with hint "Swipe down to dismiss".

### Performance

- **Zero-transcendental specular (`GlassSpecularSharpness` enum)** — Replaced `pow(lightCatch, exponent)` in `lightweight_glass.frag` (compiles to two transcendentals on Metal/Mali/Adreno) with a `GlassSpecularSharpness` enum (`.soft`, `.medium`, `.sharp`) encoded as an integer uniform. GPU compiler fully unrolls each level into a pure squaring chain — zero transcendentals. Default is `.medium`.
- **`pow(x, 1.5)` → `x·√x` in Impeller edge lighting** — Replaces the last `pow()` call in the final render shader. `sqrt()` is a single hardware SFU instruction on Metal/Vulkan/OpenGLES.
- **Anisotropic specular in lightweight shader** — The 20% tangent-stretch oval specular (previously Impeller-only) is now applied in `lightweight_glass.frag`. Skia/Web now shows the same horizontal oval highlight as Impeller.
- **Fresnel rim brightening in lightweight shader** — Grazing-angle rim luminosity ported from `liquid_glass_final_render.frag` to `lightweight_glass.frag`. Closes the largest remaining visual gap between rendering paths.
- **Content-adaptive glass strength** — Glass intensity auto-adjusts based on backdrop luminance (Impeller) or `MediaQuery.platformBrightness` (lightweight/Skia/Web), matching iOS 26's adaptive material behaviour.

### Developer Experience

- **`GlassRefractionSource`** — renamed from `LiquidGlassBackground` to better reflect its role as the shader capture surface. `LiquidGlassBackground` remains as a deprecated `typedef` alias (removed in 1.0.0).
- **Synchronous background capture** — The Skia/Web refraction capture pipeline for interactive indicators (`GlassSegmentedControl`, `GlassTabBar`, `GlassBottomBar`) was rebuilt using `boundary.toImageSync()` on native (synchronous, GPU-resident, zero CPU←GPU readback) and async `toImage()` on web (9× smaller than the previous path).

---

# 0.6.1


### Visual Quality

- **True surface normal storage in geometry texture (Renderer V1)** — The geometry
  texture previously stored the refraction *displacement* vector (`dispX, dispY`) in
  its RG channels. The final render shader then approximated the surface normal as
  `normalize(displacement)`, which is correct for a single convex SDF shape but
  **wrong in blend-group neck zones** (where a smooth-union joins two shapes): the
  displacement vector diverges from the actual surface normal, producing misplaced
  specular highlights at the join.

  The geometry pass now stores the **true SDF-gradient-derived normal** (`normal.x`,
  `normal.y`) in RG instead. The render shader decodes the normal, reconstructs
  `normal.z = sqrt(1 − x² − y²)`, and recomputes the displacement exactly via the
  same `refract()` call — no approximation. Edge lighting then uses the genuine
  surface normal throughout.

  **Result:** Specular highlights on blended glass shapes (e.g. two overlapping
  pills) now correctly follow the true surface curvature rather than the refraction
  direction. Single-shape surfaces are visually identical to 0.6.0.

  **Files changed:** `shaders/displacement_encoding.glsl`,
  `shaders/liquid_glass_geometry_blended.frag`,
  `shaders/liquid_glass_final_render.frag`

- **Anisotropic specular highlights (Impeller)** — The specular lobe is now
  stretched 20% along the surface tangent before the dot-product with the light
  direction, producing a horizontal oval highlight (matching iOS 26) rather than
  a circular dot.  Only the dot-product uses the stretched vector; geometry and
  `edgeFactor` are unchanged.

  **Files changed:** `shaders/liquid_glass_final_render.frag`

- **Fresnel edge luminosity ramp (Impeller)** — A subtle brightness ramp is
  now applied at grazing angles (the glass rim) using the already-decoded
  `normalZ` component. `(1 − normalZ) × edgeFactor × 0.10` adds a
  gentle brightening that matches iOS 26's centre-to-edge luminosity gradient.
  Fully branchless, zero extra texture accesses.

  **Files changed:** `shaders/liquid_glass_final_render.frag`

- **Luminosity-preserving glass tint in lightweight shader (Skia/Web)** — The
  `lightweight_glass.frag` shader (surface widgets on all platforms in standard
  quality, and on Skia/Web in premium quality) previously used a crude additive
  tint: `finalColor + uGlassColor.rgb × 0.2`. This was replaced with the same
  `applyGlassColor()` model used by the Impeller path since v0.5.0:
  - **Achromatic glass** (white/grey/black): direct `mix()` so white glass lifts
    toward white (a frost/brightness effect).
  - **Chromatic glass** (blue/amber/green): luminance-preserving hue shift —
    backdrop brightness is held, only chroma shifts toward the glass colour.

  **Files changed:** `shaders/lightweight_glass.frag`

### Performance

- **Branchless `smoothUnion` in SDF shader (Impeller)** — Eliminated a
  conditional branch (`if blend == 0.0`) that caused warp divergence when adjacent
  glass shapes transition between merged and separate. Replaced with a
  mathematically equivalent multiply: `m = m * step(0.0, blend)`.

  **Files changed:** `shaders/sdf.glsl`

- **`if/else if` dispatch in `getShapeSDF` (Impeller)** — Sequential `if`
  statements evaluated all shape type comparisons for every fragment. Converted
  to an `if/else if` chain so the GPU can short-circuit after the first match.
  The default return changed from `1e9` (invisible bug) to `0.0` (clearly inside
  shape — a visible failure mode that makes incorrect shapes obvious).

  **Files changed:** `shaders/sdf.glsl`

- **Single texture fetch when chromatic aberration is disabled (Skia/Web)** —
  `interactive_indicator.frag` previously sampled the background texture three
  times unconditionally (one per channel for chromatic aberration). An early-exit
  branch for `uChromaticAberration < 0.01` (the default for every widget) reduces
  this to a single fetch — 66% fewer texture reads in the common case.

  **Files changed:** `shaders/interactive_indicator.frag`

- **Flat-interior early-exit in final render shader (Impeller)** — For large
  glass surfaces (GlassAppBar, GlassPanel), the vast majority of pixels are in the
  flat interior where `normalXY ≈ 0`. Previously `refract()` plus 1–3 texture
  samples ran on all pixels, producing a mathematically zero displacement.
  A `dot(normalXY, normalXY) < 1e−4` guard now skips to a single background sample
  for flat pixels — lossless (displacement is provably zero when normal is flat).

  **Files changed:** `shaders/liquid_glass_final_render.frag`

---

# 0.6.0

### Breaking Changes

- **`LiquidGlassLayer.useBackdropGroup` removed.** Glass layers now automatically
  detect a `BackdropGroup` ancestor in the tree and opt into blit-sharing with no
  opt-in parameter required. Remove `useBackdropGroup: true` from any
  `LiquidGlassLayer(...)` calls — the behaviour is now unconditionally correct.

### New Features

- **`LiquidGlassWidgets.wrap()`** — convenience shorthand that wraps your app in a
  `GlassBackdropScope` with a single change in `main.dart`:
  ```dart
  runApp(LiquidGlassWidgets.wrap(const MyApp()));
  ```
  All glass surfaces inside automatically share a single GPU backdrop capture on
  Impeller, halving blur blit cost whenever two or more glass widgets are visible
  simultaneously (e.g. `GlassAppBar` + `GlassBottomBar`). On Skia/Web the
  lightweight shader path is used, so this has no effect there.

- **`GlassMotionScope`** — drives the glass specular highlight angle from any
  `Stream<double>` (e.g. device gyroscope via `sensors_plus`). Wraps its subtree in
  an updated `GlassTheme` that overrides `lightAngle` on each stream event. No new
  dependencies required.

### Performance

- **`GlassBackdropScope` auto-activation** — glass layers now automatically call
  `BackdropGroup.of(context)` on every build. If a `GlassBackdropScope` (or any
  `BackdropGroup`) ancestor is present, the blur `BackdropFilterLayer` opts into
  shared backdrop capture — zero per-widget configuration. Without an ancestor the
  behaviour is identical to the previous default.

- **Local-space geometry rasterization** — the geometry texture is now rasterized in
  the layer's own coordinate space rather than screen space. The GPU image is cached
  until the pill's intrinsic size or shape changes, eliminating per-frame geometry
  rebuilds during animation (tab slides, jelly physics). A transform correction matrix
  is used in the shader to map from screen `fragCoord` back to the cached local
  geometry without re-rasterizing.

- **Shader UV bounds check** — the final render shader now discards fragments where
  the geometry UV falls outside `[0, 1]`. This prevents the sampler's edge-clamping
  from producing a thin "protruding line" artifact at the pill's left and right
  extremes during jelly-physics expansion (the `clipExpansion` region).

### Visual

- **Refraction UV fix** — the final render shader uses the explicit `uSize` uniform
  (physical-pixel size of the backdrop) for UV derivation. `textureSize()` was tried
  but returns `(0,0)` on the first frame in Impeller's `BackdropFilterLayer` context,
  causing invisible first-frame renders. The `uSize` path is always valid.
- **`precision highp float`** in final render shader — was `mediump`, risking colour
  banding (10-bit mantissa on mobile). Matches the geometry shader which was already
  fixed in 0.5.0.
- **iOS 26 glass tint model** — `applyGlassColor` now preserves backdrop luminance
  while shifting chroma toward the glass color. Previously used Photoshop Overlay mode.
- **`sdfSquircle` correctness fix** — reverted to the Euclidean rounded-rectangle SDF.
  The earlier n=4 superellipse approximation degenerated for pill shapes where
  `borderRadius ≈ min(width, height) / 2`, making glass invisible.
- **Saturation before lighting** — specular highlights remain white/neutral.
- **Unified lighting angle** — centralized across all components.

### Fixes

- **Web & WASM support** — removed `dart:io` imports from shader resolution logic.
- **Leading-dot rim artifact** — removed bright corner artifact on the pill indicator
  during drag by soft-clamping (`x / (1 + x)`) highlight intensity.
- **Impeller indicator clipping** — jelly physics animations no longer clip at the
  static bounding box. `clipExpansion` parameter added to `GlassEffect` and
  `RenderLiquidGlassLayer`.

### Performance / Dependencies

- **Removed `motor` dependency** — replaced with self-contained `glass_spring.dart`.
  Zero third-party runtime dependencies beyond the Flutter SDK.

---


# 0.5.0

### Breaking Changes

**`LiquidGlass` removed from the public API.**
`LiquidGlass` is an Impeller-only primitive — it silently renders nothing on Skia/web. It was inadvertently exposed in previous versions. Use `AdaptiveGlass` (or any `Glass*` widget) instead: these automatically choose the correct rendering path for the current platform.

```dart
// Before (broken on Skia/web — renders nothing)
LiquidGlass(settings: LiquidGlassSettings(...), child: ...)

// After (works on all platforms)
AdaptiveGlass(settings: LiquidGlassSettings(...), child: ...)
```

`LiquidGlassLayer`, `LiquidGlassBlendGroup`, `LiquidGlassSettings`, `LiquidShape`, `GlassGlow`, and `debugPaintLiquidGlassGeometry` remain public for advanced use.

---

### New Features

- **FEAT**: `GlassBackdropScope` — halves GPU blur capture cost when multiple glass surfaces are on screen at once (e.g. `GlassAppBar` + `GlassBottomBar`).
  - Wrap your `MaterialApp` or `Scaffold` with `GlassBackdropScope` to activate shared backdrop capture.
  - Safe to add unconditionally: when no `GlassBackdropScope` ancestor is present, behaviour is identical to the previous default.

```dart
GlassBackdropScope(
  child: MaterialApp(
    home: Scaffold(
      appBar: GlassAppBar(...),
      bottomNavigationBar: GlassBottomBar(...),
      body: ...,
    ),
  ),
)
```

---

### Renderer — Vendored (internal, no API change)

The renderer source from `liquid_glass_renderer` (by whynotmake.it, MIT) is now vendored directly into `liquid_glass_widgets`. This gives us full control over the rendering pipeline and lets us ship fixes and improvements in lock-step with the widget layer. No user-facing API changes.

Local patches applied during vendoring:

| ID | Description |
|----|-------------|
| B1 | `LiquidGlassBlendGroup`: added `ImageFilter.isShaderFilterSupported` guard — prevented Skia/web "Invalid SkSL" crash |
| B3 | `liquid_glass_geometry_blended.frag`: `mediump` → `highp` float precision — eliminated ~1.5px displacement banding on mobile |
| B5 | `render.glsl`: removed dead `calculateDispersiveIndex` function (Cauchy dispersion, never called) |
| B6 | `render.glsl`: removed dead `blurRadius` parameter from `calculateRefraction` |
| A1 | `GeometryRenderLink.markRebuilt` → `notifyGeometryChanged` — corrected inverted method name (it sets `_dirty = true`, not clears it) |
| V4 | `liquid_glass_final_render.frag`: replaced 8-line inline highlight block with `getHighlightColor()` — eliminates duplicate colour logic |

---

# 0.4.1-dev.2

### Bug Fixes

- **FIX**: `GlassBottomBar` (and other surfaces) now correctly respond to dynamic `glassSettings` changes on `GlassQuality.standard`
  - `AdaptiveGlass` in grouped mode was using empty default settings instead of inheriting from the parent `AdaptiveLiquidGlassLayer`, causing `glassColor` (including alpha) to be ignored entirely on the lightweight shader path
  - Fixed by reading settings from `InheritedLiquidGlass` in grouped mode, consistent with how the Impeller path behaves
- **FIX**: Luminance-aware ambient floor for white glass on `GlassQuality.standard`
  - `LiquidGlassSettings.figma()` hardcodes `ambientStrength: 0.1`, causing white glass to render as dark grey in the lightweight shader
  - Applied a `brightnessIntent = alpha × luminance × 0.6` floor so high-opacity white glass renders with appropriate brightness without affecting calibrated presets

---

# 0.4.1-dev.1

### Breaking Changes

**Library-wide `IconData` → `Widget` API migration.** All icon parameters across the library now accept any `Widget` — enabling SVG, PNG, and custom assets alongside standard `Icon()`. Standard `Icon` widgets automatically inherit the correct color and size via `IconTheme` with no visual change.

**Migration for all affected widgets:** wrap bare `IconData` values in `Icon()`:
```dart
// Before (all widgets)
GlassButton(icon: CupertinoIcons.heart, onTap: () {})

// After
GlassButton(icon: Icon(CupertinoIcons.heart), onTap: () {})

// Or use any custom widget (new capability)
GlassButton(icon: SvgPicture.asset('assets/heart.svg'), onTap: () {})
```

Affected widgets and parameters:

| Widget | Parameter(s) |
|--------|-------------|
| `GlassButton` | `icon: Widget?` (was `IconData?`) |
| `GlassIconButton` | `icon: Widget` (was `IconData`) |
| `GlassChip` | `icon: Widget?`, `deleteIcon: Widget?` (were `IconData?`) |
| `GlassPullDownButton` | `icon: Widget?` (was `IconData?`) |
| `GlassSideBarItem` | `icon: Widget` (was `IconData`) |
| `GlassMenuItem` | `icon: Widget?` (was `IconData?`) |
| `GlassActionSheetAction` | `icon: Widget?` (was `IconData?`) |
| `GlassTab` | `icon: Widget?` (was `IconData?`) |
| `GlassPicker` | `icon: Widget?` (was `IconData?`) |
| `GlassToast` / `GlassSnackBar` | `icon: Widget?` (was `IconData?`) |
| `GlassBottomBarTab` | `icon: Widget` (was `IconData`) |
| `GlassBottomBarExtraButton` | `icon: Widget` (was `IconData`) |

- **BREAKING**: `GlassBottomBarTab.selectedIcon` renamed to `activeIcon` (`Widget?`)
  - Aligns with Flutter's `BottomNavigationBarItem.activeIcon` naming convention
  - **Migration:** Replace `selectedIcon:` with `activeIcon:` at all call sites

### New Features

- **FEAT**: `GlassBottomBar.iconLabelSpacing` — configurable vertical gap between tab icon and label (contributed by @baneizalfe in PR #11 — thanks!)
  - Previously hardcoded to 4px; now exposed as a parameter (default: `4.0`)
  - Useful for aligning with iOS 26 tab bar design guidelines

# 0.4.0-dev.7


### Bug Fixes

- **FIX**: Corner radius extraction logic in `LightweightLiquidGlass` and `GlassEffect`
  - Added support for `int` values (e.g., `16`) previously causing silent extraction failures
  - Fixed heuristic issue where an explicit `0.0` radius was overridden by default `16.0` rounding
  - Improved `BorderRadiusGeometry` resolution using `TextDirection.ltr`
  - Ensures consistent "sharp corner" behavior across all rendering backends

### Examples

- **FEAT**: Added Shape and Radius debug example
  - New `example/lib/repro_issue.dart` for verifying button shapes and radii in isolation
  - Demonstrates `LiquidOval`, `LiquidRoundedRectangle`, and `LiquidRoundedSuperellipse` configurations

---

# 0.4.0-dev.6

### Bug Fixes

- **FIX**: Shader refactoring to resolve Impeller crashes on iOS Simulators
  - Packed uniforms into `vec4` arrays to stay under the Metal 14-binding limit
  - Resolved "Could not create render pipeline" errors on simulated devices
- **FIX**: Shader asset resolution in unit tests
  - Added fallback path mechanism to correctly load shaders in test environments
  - Eliminates "Asset not found" exceptions during `flutter test`

---

# 0.4.0-dev.5

### Bug Fixes

```

---

# 0.3.0-dev.1

### Breaking Changes

- **`quality` parameter is now nullable** across all widgets that support it
  - Previously: `quality: GlassQuality.standard` (required, with default)
  - Now: `quality: GlassQuality?` (nullable, inherits from parent layer)
  - **Migration:** Most code will work without changes. Only affects code that relied on the parameter being non-nullable.

### New Features

- **Quality Inheritance System**
  - All widgets now inherit `quality` from parent `AdaptiveLiquidGlassLayer`
  - Explicitly set `quality` on a widget to override inheritance
  - Simplifies code by setting quality once at the layer level

- **Showcase App**
  - New showcase app demonstrating liquid glass widgets in action
  - Centralized theme system with predefined glass settings
  - Real-world examples of quality inheritance patterns

### Bug Fixes

- **Critical: Fixed glass shader rendering order**
  - Glass shader now renders **behind** content, not on top
  - Fixes text appearing washed out with semi-transparent glass
  - Affects all widgets using `LightweightLiquidGlass`

### Migration Guide

**For most users, no code changes are required!**

#### If you don't specify `quality`:
```dart
// Before (0.2.x)
GlassButton(icon: Icons.star, onTap: () {})

// After (0.3.x) - No changes needed!
GlassButton(icon: Icons.star, onTap: () {})
```

#### If you explicitly set `quality`:
```dart
// Before (0.2.x)
GlassButton(quality: GlassQuality.premium, icon: Icons.star, onTap: () {})

// After (0.3.x) - No changes needed!
GlassButton(quality: GlassQuality.premium, icon: Icons.star, onTap: () {})
```

#### New: Use inheritance for cleaner code:
```dart
// Before (0.2.x) - Repetitive
AdaptiveLiquidGlassLayer(
  settings: settings,
  child: Column([
    GlassButton(quality: GlassQuality.premium, ...),
    GlassButton(quality: GlassQuality.premium, ...),
    GlassTextField(quality: GlassQuality.premium, ...),
  ]),
)

// After (0.3.x) - Set once, inherit everywhere
AdaptiveLiquidGlassLayer(
  quality: GlassQuality.premium,
  settings: settings,
  child: Column([
    GlassButton(...),  // Inherits premium
    GlassButton(...),  // Inherits premium
    GlassTextField(...),  // Inherits premium
  ]),
)
```

#### Only if you relied on non-nullable quality:
If your code explicitly checks for non-null quality (rare), add null checks:
```dart
// Before (0.2.x)
final quality = widget.quality; // Always GlassQuality

// After (0.3.x)
final quality = widget.quality ?? GlassQuality.standard;
```
